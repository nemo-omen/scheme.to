# Scheme.to

Scheme.to is a project for the Spring 2022 session of CS3312 — Web Programming — at Angelo State University.

Because the concentration for the class is the creation of front-end single page applications, that's what this project will be.

Frameworks, however, will not be used.

## What's it going to be?

I haven't really planned the project yet, but I think I'd like to create an app that mimics a monthly, weekly, or daily planner page. Essentially an easy place to make plans with various views depending on the level of detail the user needs.
